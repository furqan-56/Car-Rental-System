# Car Rental System

## Overview
Our Car Rental System is structured around a set of classes designed to manage the complexities of a rental service. The system includes a `Car` class with derived classes `Economy` and `Luxury` to handle specific types of cars, and a `Customer` class for managing customer information. The `RentalSystem` class integrates these components to facilitate car rentals and generate detailed invoices.

## Features
- **Data Management**: Cars are managed through a hierarchical class system with `Car` as the base class.
- **File Input**: Car data is retrieved from a text file and organized into an array for easy access.
- **User Interaction**: The system offers a menu-driven interface, allowing users to:
  1. **Choose a Car**: Select from economy or luxury options.
  2. **Specify Rental Duration**: Determine how long the car will be rented.
  3. **Provide Customer Information**: Enter details such as name, phone number, and address.
- **Invoice Generation**: After inputting all necessary data, the system generates an invoice that includes car details, rental period, customer details, and total fare.
